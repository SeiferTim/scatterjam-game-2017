Nice night for trick-or-treating.

Time to go to bed.

Stop staring, please!

Are you trick-or-treating as well?
OH NO! Someone stole my candy! T.T Why MEEEEEE?
Yes?

You need something?
Candy! Yum!
Go away!
There are zombies on your la-hawn. There's a zooombie on our la-awn.

Some of these people here are creepy...
I think maybe some of these kids are monsters...
Are you... Okay?
